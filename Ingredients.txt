Ingredients:

4-6 large lemons
1 cup sugar
6 cups water
Instructions:

Cut the lemons in half and squeeze the juice into a pitcher. Remove any seeds that may have fallen into the juice.
In a saucepan, combine the sugar and 1 cup of water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove the saucepan from heat and allow the syrup to cool.
Add the syrup to the pitcher with the lemon juice and stir to combine.
Add the remaining 5 cups of water to the pitcher and stir again.
Taste the lemonade and adjust the sweetness to your liking by adding more sugar or water as necessary.
Chill the lemonade in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving.
Optional variations:

Add sliced lemons and/or mint leaves to the pitcher for a decorative touch.
Replace some of the water with sparkling water or club soda for a fizzy lemonade.
Substitute honey or agave nectar for the sugar for a healthier version of the recipe.
